## What is curtlink.xyz
It's basically *ANOTHER* link shortener. But why is it special, you might ask? Shortened links are only valid for 24 hours and shortened domains have to support SSL (and have it corectly set up) *and* not be on our blocklist. In the future, curtlink.xyz might check popular malicious domain blacklists to be extra secure. curtlink.xyz also generates a handy QR code for you.
